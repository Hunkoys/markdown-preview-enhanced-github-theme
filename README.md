# Github Theme for Markdown Preview Enhanced

Get the extension here: [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced)

It takes your system's theme setting to determine Light/Dark mode.

## Usage

Run this on your Command Palette

![command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunkoys/markdown-preview-enhanced-github-theme/master/command.png)

then it will open a less file. Replace everything in it with the [style.css](https://github.com/Hunkoys/markdown-preview-enhanced-github-theme/blob/main/style.css) from this repo.

## Done!

Thanks to [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) for supplying the css.
* I fixed his original css a little bit to work with [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced)
